		<h1>Hello I am Ray Hogenson</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the world wide web. Nowadays it seems that anyone
		can have a website. But why would you want to? That's the
		question that is pressing to me and so many others these
		days.</p>

		<p>You may notice that this website has no style sheet. Do not
		be alarmed. It is not the case that I don't know <i>how</i> to
		make a website look nice, it is the case that I don't know
		<i>why</i> to make a website look nice. I could easily copy
		some pretty looking style sheet from someone else, or even
		write my own, but I simply cannot be bothered. This website
		contains all the information, and information is really what's
		important in this day and age. Furthermore, since I'm writing
		this HTML by hand, it would be work to copy and paste the
		header onto every page, work that I am not willing to do.</p>
