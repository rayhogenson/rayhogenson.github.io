2017-04-20 Kimi No Na Wa
</h2>
<p>Last night I watched Kimi No Na Wa, the new &quot;hit movie&quot; from Makoto
Shinkai, and which is now second only to Spirited Away in box office
revenue in Japan. It was excellent. Perhaps the best movie I have seen
to date. Spoilers to follow.</p>
<p>The beginning was well put-together, it was pretty mysterious but also
pretty obvious what was happening. The audience figures out what's going
on right as the characters do. And once they—and we—figured out what's
going on, their actions made so much sense. They behaved rationally and
tried to make the best of this situation. They're lovable characters and
their interaction is made even more lovable by how bizarre it is; they
set each other's lives up for interesting scenarios, both for fun and
because they care about each other and want to improve the other's life.</p>
<p>And then the true excitement starts, with the revelation that in fact
the time is out of sync and the comet will destroy the town. Then it
gains kind of an adventure genre feel, which I greatly enjoyed. It had
excitement and suspense and because we had grown to love the characters,
there was a true desire that the characters would figure everything out.
The excitement continued through this part, it was never boring.</p>
<p>Then the ending. After they were separated, having shared so much, can't
even remember the other's name. Then they come so close to meeting, time
after time, this was the most stressful but also the most exciting part
of the movie. Andrew made the comparison to La La Land, but I feel like
the ending is what mostly distinguishes the two movies. Whereas La La
Land sets you up for happiness then dashes it with some depressing
message about life, this one sets you up for disappointment in a magical
setting, then gives back everything it promised and more with the ending
where they actually do find each other. They're not so weak that they
would just ignore each other.</p>
<p>Moreover the movie was beautiful. The best looking animated movie I have
ever seen, perhaps even the best looking movie overall, though Mad Max
Fury Road is quite the visual spectacle. The character designs were
plain, but this didn't detract from the movie at least while it was
happening. I can't be sure this wasn't a stylistic decision, but I can't
be sure it was, either.</p>
<p>Anyway, great movie. It pulled on my emotions in enjoyable ways.</p>

2017-04-18 Tumblr
</h2>
<p>I used to have a tumblr blog. I made it in high school to host my memes.
Even now the material there is, I think, pretty high quality for the
most part. Of course there's a bit of trash, but there's always a bit of
trash mixed in with anything great. The url is
<a href="https://btruml.tumblr.com">btruml.tumblr.com</a>. Don't mind the style
sheet, I
just tried to make it as inconvenient as possible to actually look at my
content. I was in to that kind of thing back then.</p>
<p>But the point of this post is only half reminiscence. The other is to
discuss my feelings about the tumblr community. They've created a kind
of echo chamber in which only the stereotypical &quot;safe space&quot; kind of
things are permitted. Anything else won't be accepted in the community.
Don't get me wrong, though, I agree with the community on most issues. I
do not feel, as many do, that they give feminism a bad name, or even
that they are taking these issues too far. My only issue is that the
echo-chamber kind of community creates stagnation in which new ideas
aren't accepted. This can be dangerous when taken to the extreme, and
although they're right about many issues, there's always the
possibility that if they're wrong, there's no one to tell them this.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when I started this post I expected this review to
be more positive, but because I'll probably write all posts in a
stream-of-consciousness style, I guess this is where my consciousness
truly lies on the issue.</p>
<p>Aha but this is only half of why I wrote this post. The other half is
that I want to resume my blog. My plan is this: I'll gather many high
quality memes, then dump them one day at a time to my blog. I like this
plan because the alternative is to post one thing whenever I think of
it, and it'll eventually die when I forget for too long. So by thinking
of memes ahead of time I can get in the habit of it and when I finally
start posting, my return will be glorious.</p>

2017-04-11 Test Post
</h2>
<p>I've decided to make a blog. Here I'll post my thoughts about various
matters, whenever I have something important enough to talk about. I was
inspired by sudoscript.com, but I've been thinking about this for a
while. Updates will come soon…</p>
